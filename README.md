# GraphAesthetics
---
Goal: Predict images which share the same aesthetic

Method: Link prediction between nodes containing colour, feature, and CV information of images. Pre-processing [can be found here](https://github.com/kokostino/GraphAesthetics-PreProcessing).

Currently under development, notebooks so far:

- Node2vec + LightGBM (nx + sklearn)
- Graph Autoencoder (Pytorch Geometric)
- GraphSAGE (stellargraph + tensorflow)
